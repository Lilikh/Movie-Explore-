*** Issue with Demo Deployed on Vercel ***

# Deploy a Demo on Vercel 
- I deployed my code on Vercel, but after deployment, I ran into an issue. Specifically, when I try to search for a movie " Error: Failed to fetch movies " , I encounter a CORS error. The core problem seems to be that Vercel doesn't support the  OMDB API, which is causing these errors
