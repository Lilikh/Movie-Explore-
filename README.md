*** Issue with Demo Deployed on Vercel ***

# Deploy a Demo on Vercel 
- I deployed my code on Vercel, but after deployment, I ran into an issue. Specifically, when I try to search for a    movie(Error: Failed to fetch movies), I encounter a CORS error. The core problem seems to be that Vercel doesn't support the TMDB API, which is causing these errors
